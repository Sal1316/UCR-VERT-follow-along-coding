import JSXVariables from "./components/JSXVariables";

export const App = () => {
  return <JSXVariables />;
}

// export default App; // dont need this since we changed the syntax where we are importing App. 

/* NOTES: 

- when we use 'export' in the function, we are able to destructure the fx where we import it. ex, import { App } from './App';
