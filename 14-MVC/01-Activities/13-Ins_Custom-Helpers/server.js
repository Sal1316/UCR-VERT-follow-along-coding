/*NOTES: 

- Incorporating Helpers: what we have to do is pass the helpes as the properties
  of the object. In this case they are the properties of the express handlebars obj.
  This will make the properties available to us in the application. The property,
  might need to be called 'helpers' due to the convention. ex, { helpers: { format_time: () => {} }}
  Calling the property invokes the fx.
