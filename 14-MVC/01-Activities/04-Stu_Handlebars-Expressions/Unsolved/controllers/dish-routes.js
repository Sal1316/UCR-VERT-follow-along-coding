/* NOTES: 

- The value of ":num" is captured from the URL and made available as req.params.num.

- render(param1, param2), 
  + param1, specifies the name of the view template to be rendered.
  + param2, is what you want to pass in to the view template.

- dishes[req.params.num - 1] > need to sub 1 since its an array index.
